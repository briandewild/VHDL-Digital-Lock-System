# VHDL-Digital-Lock-System
A VHDL-based digital lock implemented with an FSM. The user enters a three-digit code using the Basys 3 push buttons (values 0–3). After three inputs, the system lights an LED to indicate success or failure. The correct sequence is 0–2–3; a different LED signals an incorrect code.
